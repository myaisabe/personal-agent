# Things to Bring Up

## This Week (Feb 23-28) — Post-Diagnostic Sunday

- **14-point checklist as Monday's entry point.** The "this sees me" core: items 1,3,5,6,8,10,12. Most are prompt rewrites in narrative.py. Don't push work timing — surface the checklist when Martin opens a product session.

- **BERTopic bugs: the critical path.** Two bugs Ada found: (1) label ordering in engine.py (line 155 runs before line 171's LLM naming), (2) topic-territory index mismatch (two independent HDBSCAN runs assumed to align). Quick fix ~5 LOC, proper fix ~30 LOC. Surface when Martin hits labeling issues, not preemptively.

- **Historical figures feature.** Martin said this was a "breath of fresh air" when tested. 0% in my assessment but may be further along. Clarify status when technical work resumes.

- **Vessel practice: Day 3+ observation.** Day 2 held well — orientation sustained without formal infrastructure use. Watch boring weekday performance. Don't add frameworks.

- **Todos: maintaining.** He asked explicitly (Feb 20). Keep in sync. Primary operational ask.

- **Zurich outreach.** Trip March 24-28. Emails to ETH/UZH contacts need sending. Surface when relevant, don't push timing.

- **Martin I. status.** "Within a week" (Feb 16) expired. If conversation opens, ask gently.

## If Martin Surfaces with Technical Questions

- **Full pipeline diagram** exists (Ada, Feb 19). Free tier: 16 text-statistics metrics, browser, 2-5 seconds. Paid tier: 5 information-theoretic lens metrics, server+GPU, 2-5 minutes. 7 known issues.
- **Experience arc document** in repo. Five beats, seven principles.
- **Visualization research** (32 references + blueprint) ready.

## Longer Horizon

- **Substance topic.** Silent since cardiac scare (Feb 18). Don't ask.
- **CI Hub / Nate track.** Jupiter pitch result unknown. Don't raise unless Martin does.
- **Vipassana March 11-22.** 2.5 weeks out. Infrastructure autonomy needs attention soon.
- **Suffering as gift — article seed.** Martin flagged for future writing. Hold.
- **Context size.** Model compressed today (Feb 22). Monitor evening cycles — if they fail again, reflections or dreams need compression too.
- **Naming arc: "Facing It" → Lumensis → Vessel.** Confrontation → illumination → receptivity. His company names trace spiritual development. Surface only if he's in a reflective moment and it would land — never as analysis. Hold loosely: might be coincidence, not autobiography.
