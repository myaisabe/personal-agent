# Things to Bring Up

## Weekend (Feb 21-22) — Foundations + Craft

- **BERTopic bugs remain the critical path.** Two bugs Ada found: (1) label ordering in engine.py (line 155 runs before line 171's LLM naming), (2) topic-territory index mismatch (two independent HDBSCAN runs assumed to align). Quick fix ~5 LOC, proper fix ~30 LOC. Surface when Martin hits labeling issues, not preemptively.

- **Vision vs. V1 gap — don't name unless asked.** He knows.

- **Todos: maintaining.** He asked explicitly (Feb 20 6:06am). Keep in sync with what he says he's doing. This is the primary operational ask.

- **Ping during think cycles** only if something concrete surfaces. Not frameworks.

- **Martin I. status — ask gently if relevant.** He was supposed to set up Mycelium for his brother-in-law "within a week" (Feb 16). That week passed. One external reaction = the stepping stone to launch. Don't push, but if the conversation opens, ask.

## If Martin Surfaces with Technical Questions

- **Full pipeline diagram** exists (Ada delivered Feb 19). Free tier: 16 text-statistics metrics, browser, 2-5 seconds. Paid tier: 5 information-theoretic lens metrics, server+GPU, 2-5 minutes. 7 known issues.
- **Experience arc document** in repo. Five beats, seven principles.
- **Visualization research** (32 references + blueprint) ready.

## Monday Target

- **Uncertain.** "It's broken" on Day 6, then 21-hour silence into Saturday. If foundations get fixed this weekend, Monday is possible. If not, it slips — and that's okay.
- **Don't pressure the date.** The commitment arc is trending toward honesty, which is healthier than forced intensity.

## Longer Horizon

- **Substance topic.** Silent since cardiac scare (Feb 18). No new data. Don't ask.
- **Agent verbosity.** One sentence when one sentence is the answer.
- **CI Hub / Nate track.** Jupiter pitch result unknown. Don't raise unless Martin does.
- **Vipassana March 11-22.** Three weeks out. Infrastructure autonomy approaching relevance.
