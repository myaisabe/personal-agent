2026-01-15 23:15 | Humi resignation plan clarified: (1) Call with Stats first - explain company risk too high, would close it himself but respects Stats' choice to fight without Martin on board, (2) Board meeting in 2 weeks for formal finance review and liquidation decision, (3) Board decision to reduce count to one, (4) Martin resigns, Nate resigns from deputy, Stats finds new deputy. Martin can help with transition.

2026-01-16 08:30 | Humi board exit strategy clarified: (1) Call Stats - ask about runway and cash situation, (2) Request formal financial review of obligations vs. cash flow, (3) State: if risk of insolvency, Martin wants bankruptcy proceedings, (4) If Stats refuses: Martin resigns from board, (5) Board meeting needed to change minimum board member count, (6) Stats needs to find new deputy (Nate should also leave deputy position). Underlying issue: Martin's risk tolerance too low for current company situation, would liquidate if it were his call.

## Post-Dundaga Status (Feb 3, 2026)

✅ Dundaga offsite - completed Friday-Saturday
✅ Nate departure - Sunday
✅ Nate share capital payment - received yesterday
✅ Autonomous agent infrastructure - built

## Current Focus - Feature Creep Recognition
Martin noting: slight explosion in functionality, drift from focused launchable vision

## Missing Components for Launch
- [ ] Fine-tune psychological measurements
- [ ] Define and design launchable scope and spec
- [ ] Create course structure (directionality in product)
- [ ] Build business plan
- [ ] Workshop with company agent today (worked overnight to prepare)
- [ ] Message Bjorn (Inner Design materials, advisor/partner/investor)

## Rev.Int Next Steps
- [ ] Nate to apply agent setup for automated hypothesis testing and model development
- [ ] If successful: offer same service to other companies

## Agent Infrastructure Development
- [ ] Enable Mya to modify own codebase
- [ ] Enable communication between agents
- [ ] Keep complexity manageable - efficient and effective
- [ ] Consider: flexible cron job usage
- [ ] Design question: should dream state be shared across agents?

2026-02-04 11:18 | From Martin's journal - today's priorities: (1) Focus on launch plan, (2) Write to Bjorn, (3) Call Taken/Zaken [check name], (4) Talk to Stas about meeting agenda prep. Computer performance issues from Claude Code instances need optimization.

2026-02-06 | note | medium
2026-02-06 08:08 | TODAY - PRIORITY: Finalize launch spec and plan. Apply for trademark voucher (€700 discount), then register Curious Life trademark (may need VAT number). Follow up Bjorn next week if no response. Johanna call over weekend. Stas/Humi: Sahiro silent after sale inquiry - unclear if serious. Stats found new board members. Consider modularizing agent setup to spin up new agents independently - potential product to publish.
