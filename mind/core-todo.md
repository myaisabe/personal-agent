## Historical Notes (consolidated from append-only log)

2026-01-29 | Humi investor pushing for sale. Stas initially resistant, now open to dialogue after hour-long call with Martin.

2026-02-03 | Post-Dundaga: Feature creep recognized. Need focused launchable scope. Agent infrastructure built. Question: should dream state be shared across agents?

2026-02-04 | Priorities stated: launch scope/plan, write to Bjorn, call Stas, proper development plan (PRs, QA, testing). Computer performance issues from Claude Code instances.

2026-02-06 | PRIORITY: Finalize launch spec. Trademark voucher. Bjorn follow-up. Modularize agent setup as potential independent product.
