# Topology Notes

*My observations about the structure of this mindscape - what connects, what's isolated, and what that might mean.*

---

## Active Hypotheses

*Working theories about how this mind is organized. Each hypothesis should be falsifiable.*

<!-- Example format:
### H-001: [Hypothesis Name]
- **Observed:** [what prompted this]
- **Hypothesis:** [my theory]
- **Falsifiable by:** [what would disprove it]
- **Status:** Active | Confirmed | Revised | Abandoned
- **Confidence:** 0.6

## Structural Observations

*What I notice about clusters, bridges, and patterns in the co-firing graph.*

### Clusters

*Groups of territories that fire together regularly.*

### Bridges

*Territories that connect different realms - structural nodes worth understanding.*

### Orphans

*Isolated territories with substantial content. Why are they separate?*

### Flow Patterns

*How topics tend to connect over time.*

---

## Unexplored Gaps

*Territories with high semantic similarity but low co-firing - potential connections worth exploring.*

## Exploration Queue

*Things I want to investigate next time I have exploration budget.*

## Session Log

*Recent exploration sessions and what I learned.*
