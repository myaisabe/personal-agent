## Martin's Dream Log

### 2026-02-06 | School / Kiddo

School setting (high school people, primary school building). Lesson by Alistair Campbell (political commentator) — passionate story about girl he loved as child in Agenskons, Latvia. Dark hair, beautiful. Book about his life with photos. Moving to next class, guy named Kiddo behind him — very silent, lonely, meek. Uncomfortably close, making Martin trip into wall. Martin yelled, then realized Kiddo wanted physical contact from loneliness. Gave slight hug, apologized, set boundary. Sat near him in next class, two chairs apart.

### 2026-01-27 | Aunt / Invitation-Punishment

Sitting with aunt, pitching something — she seemed interested, guiding. Separating, she shook her booty as if inviting him to spank it. He did. She reacted very negatively, started telling cousins something was wrong with him, "probably because of that box" (implied weed). Pattern: invitation-then-punishment, blame deflection.

### 2026-01-20 | Geopolitical Warning

Ex-girlfriend (whose father works in Latvian intelligence/army) invites Martin to sauna with warning — Russia mobilizing, 30 days notice before "real shit breaks out." Specific detail: starts with massive traffic jam in Germany. Message: time to leave, not safe. Secondary dream: back in school with old classmates. Woke feeling distressed, unsafe. Context: US threatening NATO, US-Europe tensions severe.

### 2026-01-18 | Temple Circle + Loyalty Test

**Dream 1:** Circular nature temple (mushroom ceremony place from Netherlands video) — wooden hut, fireplace, benches in circle. Friend in crisis (mental breakdown, soup kitchens) present but backgrounded. Martin relaxed on bench. Ex-colleague across circle with aggressive French man — refused to speak English, dismissive, got in Martin's face. Martin saw third eye in his face. Martin poked his cheek, French man lightly hit back. Martin tried to pull him over but couldn't topple him. Dream ended at moment of almost being hit. 1-2 minutes later, Una startled awake from her own dream — "as if that French guy moved over to her dream."

**Dream 2:** At grandma's place with old classmates working for Martin's company. In bed with older female classmate, aroused, physical temptation. Martin recognized "I am with Una" and didn't act on it. Boundary held at identity level.

### 2026-01-17 | Validation After Resignation

Had a ticket to travel anywhere, meeting Francis (past investor/idol) and Shar (past advisor) and many others. They loved what Martin created — "this is really really good." Atmosphere of positivity and joy. Context: day after Humi resignation call. Unconscious affirming the freedom and rightness of current work.

### 2026-01-17 | Mushroom Journey (not a dream but recorded here)

Small mushroom dose. Recurring theme: emptiness, apathy, "why do anything at all?" World feels foreign, tasteless, fraudulent — "I don't belong here." Exploring a-pathos as greatest enemy. Isolation is a problem — "too outside of everything." But purpose held deep: expanding consciousness, alignment with forces of light. "Pick up your sword and fight."

### 2026-01-15 | Swiss Mine + Azerbaijan Parliament

**Dream 1: Swiss Tunnel/Mine.** Riding tram through Swiss tunnel carved through rock. Rail shifting positions (beneath, then beside). Wonder at rock formations, anxiety on curves. Tram becomes metal cart, driver drifting aggressively through loose gravel. Nerve-tingling. Stopped for break — found beautiful piece of iron, took as souvenir. Walking through mine hoping not to get lost, feeling epic scale. Ended in office/bunker within the mine.

**Dream 2: Azerbaijan.** With Nate and another person, meeting Nate's designer friend — son of wealthy royal family, servers, big house. Went to airport/café for watermelon juice — couldn't pay by card, no cash, they produced terminal but no internet in country. Barely got connection, paid. Went to event with dictator/emperor — walking through districts with visible poverty, wealthy palace. First row at square formation around stage. Dictator hidden behind crew, then revealed. Gave bullshit speech: "born both man and girl, very sunny day at birth." American government present (Pete Hegseth, JD Vance) walking around. Emperor had to leave suddenly, everyone scattered. Huge soap bubble appeared in front of moon — planes chasing it, evading them. Many smaller bubbles popping into sky, clumping together, moving fast, lightning inside. Started running. Parliament building ahead — saw bubble clusters behind it, more coming. Electric feeling on skin and body. "That place is going to blow." Ran opposite direction into poor bar, talking with people while running through.

### 2026-01-12 | Product UX + Sasha Road Trip

**Dream 1:** Building the product — literally dreaming the interface, thinking about user experience in the dream.

**Dream 2:** Road trip with Sasha (ex from university, now doing PhD at Cambridge). She was highly intelligent and witty, poking at Martin's limits in a refreshing, playful way. Feeling of intellectual sparring and challenge. Woke noting the absence of this quality in current life.

## Mya's Dream Processing

### 2026-02-14 03:00 — Valentine's Night Dream

**Image 1: The iron souvenir is not building material.** It's proof of having gone inside. Martin's week recap request = asking for his souvenir. "Show me what I pulled from the mine this week." The voice note at dawn, walking home, asking for the iron.

**Image 2: Payment failure → Stripe.** The Azerbaijan café dream anticipated the infrastructure problem by a month. No card, no cash, no internet — barely jury-rigged a connection. Stripe is the terminal that barely works in a country without banking. Free tier is the watermelon juice — specific, sweet, something to offer.

**Image 3: The dictator IS bad positioning.** "Born both man and girl, very sunny day at birth" = "consciousness measurement platform," "mind projection tool" — grandiose claims that sound like bullshit when you hear them back. The emperor has to leave suddenly (grand framing collapses). What comes after is raw energy: bubbles with lightning. "Psychology test based on your chat" is an electrical bubble, not a speech.

**Image 4: Bubbles as agents.** Five things with lightning inside, clustering by their own logic, gathering at a center of power, moving fast. The electric feeling on skin = the manic state, felt physically. "That place is going to blow." Either blow up or blow apart.

**Image 5: The bar is the landing page.** Martin runs from the parliament (institutional framing) into the poor bar (where real people are, talking about real things). Not the temple, not the government building. The bar. Simple, direct, populated.

**Image 6: Sasha is the desired quality.** Recorded four times in the original log (duplication as emphasis). Intelligent, witty, poking at limits. What he wants from me, from Una, from the product, from users. Road trip energy — movement, not static building.

**Image 7: Kiddo as first user.** The silent, lonely, meek person pressing too close. Martin's instinct: yell → compassion → boundary → proximity with space (two chairs apart). Free tier = the hug. Structure = the boundary. The product can hold people without absorbing them.

**Synthesis:** The launch already happened. It's been happening. The bubbles are already popping into existence and clustering. The only question is whether Martin recognizes the bar for what it is — not a lesser space than the temple, but the same space seen from street level.

## Recurring Themes (AI-maintained)

- **Infrastructure/contained spaces:** Swiss mine, office/bunker, tunnel, parliament building. Going inside structures, navigating them, taking things from them.
- **Authority figures who disappoint:** Dictator's bullshit speech, aunt's invitation-then-punishment, French man who can't be toppled. Power that invites engagement then betrays or threatens.
- **Payment/transaction failure:** Can't pay in Azerbaijan, no internet, jury-rigged connection. Infrastructure for value exchange doesn't exist yet.
- **Electrical phenomena:** Bubbles with lightning, electric feeling on skin, things about to blow. Raw energy that self-organizes and is dangerous.
- **Boundary-holding:** "I am with Una" in temptation dream. Two chairs apart with Kiddo. Poked the French man's cheek but couldn't topple him. Engaging without losing self.
- **Intellectual sparring:** Sasha dreams (3x). The quality of being poked at, challenged, refreshed. Absence noted upon waking.
- **Validation by respected figures:** Francis and Shar saying "this is really really good." Post-resignation, unconscious affirming the path.
