## Dream Log

2026-02-06 | observation | medium
2026-02-06 | School setting (high school people, primary school building). Lesson by Alistair Campbell (political commentator) - passionate story about girl he loved as child in Agenskons, Latvia. Dark hair, beautiful. Book about his life with photos. Moving to next class, guy named Kiddo behind him - very silent, lonely, meek. Uncomfortably close, making Martin trip into wall. Martin yelled, then realized Kiddo wanted physical contact from loneliness. Gave slight hug, apologized, set boundary. Sat near him in next class, two chairs apart.

2026-01-20 | Dream: Ex-girlfriend (whose father works in Latvian intelligence/army) invites Martin to sauna with warning - Russia mobilizing, 30 days notice before "real shit breaks out." Specific detail: starts with massive traffic jam in Germany. Message: time to leave, not safe. Secondary dream: back in school with old classmates. Woke feeling distressed, unsafe. Geopolitical context: US threatening NATO, wanting to annex part of sovereign nation, US-Europe tensions severe.

2026-01-18 | Dream 1: Circular nature temple (mushroom ceremony place from Netherlands video). Friend in crisis present but backgrounded (mental breakdown, soup kitchens, potential homelessness - echoes Stats situation?). Martin laying relaxed on bench. Ex-colleague across circle with aggressive French guy pointing at Martin, speaking only French despite requests for English. Guy got in Martin's face - Martin saw third eye. Martin poked his cheek, guy lightly hit back. Martin tried to pull him over but couldn't topple him. Dream ended at moment of almost being hit. 1-2 minutes later, Una startled awake from her own dream - felt like the French guy "moved over to her dream."

Dream 2: At grandma's place with old classmates who were working for Martin's company. In bed with older female classmate, aroused, physical contact, but Martin held boundary - "I am with Una." Temptation present but didn't act.

2026-01-18 | Two dreams: (1) Circular nature temple (mushroom ceremony place from Netherlands video) - wooden hut, fireplace, benches in circle. Friend in crisis situation (mental breakdown, living off soup kitchens) present but backgrounded. Martin relaxed on bench. Ex-colleague across circle with aggressive French man pointing/talking about Martin. Man came over, aggressive, refused to speak English, dismissive French attitude. Got in Martin's face - Martin saw third eye in his face. Martin stayed calm, poked his cheek. French man lightly hit Martin's face. Martin tried to pull him over but couldn't topple him, dream ended as he was about to hit harder. 1-2 minutes later while trying to fall back asleep, Una next to him also got startled by dream - "as if that French guy moved over to her dream." (2) At grandma's place with old classmates working for Martin's company. In bed with older female classmate, aroused, pressing against her, she getting aroused too. Martin recognized "I am with Una" and didn't act on temptation despite pull.

2026-01-18 | Dream 1: Circular nature temple (mushroom ceremony place from Netherlands video). Friend in fucked-up situation present but not in focus. Martin relaxed on bench, not reactive. Ex-colleague across circle with aggressive French guy talking about/pointing at Martin. Guy wouldn't speak English, dismissive French attitude. Got pushy, face close, Martin saw third eye in his face. Martin poked his cheek, guy lightly hit back. Martin decided to pull him over, dream ended as it seemed Martin couldn't topple him and would get hit. 1-2 minutes later, Una startled by dream - "as if that French guy moved over to her dream."

2026-01-17 | Dream of unlimited travel and validation: had a ticket to travel anywhere, meeting Francis (past investor/idol figure) and Shar (past advisor) and many others. They loved what Martin created - "this is really really good." Atmosphere: positivity and joy. Context: day after Stats resignation call, feeling light and bright.

2026-01-15 08:38 | Dream 1: Swiss tunnel/mine - traveling in tram with shifting rails, driver drifting aggressively through loose gravel, found beautiful piece of iron as souvenir, walking through epic mine formation hoping not to get lost, ended in office/bunker within the mine

Dream 2: Middle Eastern country (Azerbaijan in dream) - traveling with Nate and another person to meet designer friend who's son of royal family, wealthy with servers and big house, went to café for watermelon juice but payment issues (no card/no internet), attended event with dictator/emperor, first row in square formation around stage, dictator hidden then revealed, gave bullshit speech about being born both man and girl on sunny day, American government present (Pete Hegseth, JD Vance), emperor had to leave suddenly, huge soap bubble appeared in front of moon, planes chasing it, many smaller bubbles appeared with lightning inside them, started clumping together and moving fast, electric feeling on skin, bubbles gathering behind parliament building, ran opposite direction into poor bar talking with people

Common elements: underground/contained spaces (tunnel, bunker), movement through infrastructure, wealth disparities (royal family vs poverty), authority figures (emperor/dictator), electrical/energetic phenomena (bubbles with lightning, electric feeling), running/fleeing

## Recurring Themes (AI-maintained)

[Will be populated as patterns emerge]


2026-01-15 | observation | medium
2026-01-14 night | Two vivid dreams logged:

**Swiss Tunnel Dream:** Moving through tunnel infrastructure on tram (rail shifting positions), feeling of wonder at carved rock formations. Turns anxious as tram becomes cart with aggressive driver drifting on gravel. During break, found and took a beautiful piece of iron as souvenir from the mine. Walking through mine, feeling epic scale, hoping not to get lost. Ended in office/bunker within the mine.

**Azerbaijan/Middle East Dream:** Traveling with Nate and another person to visit Nate's designer friend (son of wealthy royal family, had servers/big house). Went to airport/cafe for watermelon juice, payment difficulties (no internet in country), barely got connection to pay. Attended event with dictator/emperor who gave bullshit speech (claimed to be born both man and girl, sunny day at birth, etc.). American government present (Pete Hegseth, JD Vance). Emperor suddenly had to leave. Then: huge soap bubble appeared in front of moon, planes chasing it, smaller bubbles popping everywhere with lightning inside. Bubbles clumping together and moving fast. Martin started running, saw bubble-cluster gathering at parliament building with electric feeling on skin. Knew it would blow. Ran opposite direction into poor bar, talking with people there.

Key elements: Taking solid artifact from infrastructure. Dictator's obvious bullshit. Power structures dissolving. Electrical buildup at government center. Running toward ordinary spaces away from the explosion point.

Jan 15 - Swiss tunnel dream: In a tram through Swiss tunnel, rail shifting positions (beneath, then side). Wondrous feeling seeing cut rock formations, turns created anxiety. Tram became metal cart with aggressive driver drifting on loose gravel, nerve-tingling. Stopped for break, found beautiful shaped iron piece as souvenir, walked around mine hoping not to get lost, felt epic nature. Ended in office/bunker within the mine.

Jan 15 - Azerbaijan/Middle Eastern country dream: With Nate and another guy visiting Nate's designer friend who was son of royal family, very wealthy with servers and big house. Went to airport/cafe for watermelon juice but couldn't pay with card, no cash, they brought terminal but no internet in country - barely got connection to pay. Went to event with dictator/emperor, walked through districts seeing poverty, wealthy temple/emperor's house. Front row square formation around stage, dictator hidden behind crew initially then revealed. Gave bullshit speech about being born both man and girl, very sunny day at birth. American government there (Pete Hegseth, JD Vance) walking around stage talking to people. Emperor had to leave, everyone scattered. Huge soap bubble appeared in front of moon, planes chasing it, it moved around evading. Many smaller bubbles appeared, clumping together, moving fast with lightning inside, exploding/popping. Started running - saw behind parliament building a clump of bubbles with more coming from distance. Electric feeling on skin and body, knew place would blow. Ran opposite direction into poor bar, talking with people there while running through.

## 2026-01-15 | Two vivid dreams

**Dream 1: Swiss Tunnel/Mine**
In Switzerland, riding tram through tunnel carved through rock. Rail shifting position (beneath, then beside). Wonder at the rock formation being cut through. Turns into anxiety on curves. Tram becomes metal cart, driver drifting aggressively through loose gravel. Nerve-tingling. 

Stop for break with small group. Walking, found beautiful piece of iron - took it as souvenir. Walking through mine hoping not to get lost. Feeling the epic nature of it.

Ended in an office/bunker within the mine.

**Dream 2: Azerbaijan/Middle Eastern Country**  
With Nate and another guy, meeting Nate's designer friend - son of wealthy royal-associated family. Servers, big house.

Went to airport/cafe for watermelon juice. Couldn't pay by card, had no cash. They produced card terminal but no internet in the country. Barely got connection, paid.

Event to meet dictator/emperor. Walking through districts - visible poverty. Emperor's house wealthy. Square formation around stage with government and royal family. Dictator hidden behind crew initially.

Speech: dictator talking bullshit - born both man and girl, very sunny day at birth. Immediate reaction: "what was this bullshit" - discussed with random person.

American government there (Pete Hegseth, JD Vance) walking around talking with people. Emperor had to leave suddenly, everyone scattered.

Huge soap bubble appeared in front of moon. Planes chasing it, it evaded them. Many smaller bubbles started popping into sky, moving around. Clumping together, moving fast. Lightning inside, exploding/popping with lightning.

Started running. Parliament building ahead - saw clump of many bubbles behind it, more coming from distance. Electric feeling on skin and body. "That place is going to blow."

Ran opposite direction into poor bar, talking with people while running through.

2026-01-17 18:12 | Mushroom journey theme: recurring emptiness, apathy, "why do anything at all?" Feels detached from world - "I don't belong here," everything tasteless and fraudulent. Exploring a-pathy vs pathos (capacity to be affected). Recognizes isolation as problem ("too outside of everything") but also holds purpose deep in heart (expanding consciousness, alignment with light). Question not whether to act but how to reconnect to feeling when disenchanted. Writes: "Having tasted ambrosia, how do you return to daily life?" Knows his capability, but struggling with coldness/detachment.

2026-01-17 18:15 | Dream after Humi resignation: Had a ticket to travel anywhere, meeting Francis (past investor/idol) and Shar (past advisor) and others who loved what Martin created, telling him "this is really really good." Atmosphere of positivity and joy. Dream integrating yesterday's decision - the freedom from stepping off board, validation from key figures.

Small mushroom dose. Recurring theme: emptiness, apathy, "why do anything at all?" The world feels foreign, tasteless, fraudulent - "I don't belong here." Wrote journal entry exploring apathy as greatest enemy of man. A-pathos: absence of feeling/suffering/being affected. Question: what does it take to have maximum pathos rather than detachment? Aware isolation is a problem - "too outside of everything." But knows his capability. Rebuilding meaning from rubble. His answer: expanding consciousness, alignment with forces of light. "Pick up your sword and fight."

2026-01-17 | Dream after Humi resignation: Had a ticket to travel anywhere, meeting Francis (past investor/idol figure) and Shar (past advisor) and others. They loved what he'd created, said "Martin this is really really good." Atmosphere of positivity and joy. Dream came the morning after stepping down from Humi board - integrating the freedom from walking away, unconscious affirming the rightness of current work.

2026-01-27 09:54 | Dream: Sitting with aunt, pitching something - she seemed interested, guiding. Separating, she shook her booty as if inviting him to spank it. He did. She reacted very negatively, started telling cousins something was wrong with him, "probably because of that box" (implied weed). Pattern: invitation-then-punishment, blame deflection.
