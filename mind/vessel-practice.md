# Vessel Practice Log

## 2026-02-21
- **Intention:** (first day — no morning intention set; practice starts tomorrow)
- **Attention:** ~2h building (infrastructure fixes, vessel practice implementation), ~2h consuming (Zurich research, Nate/CI Hub morning, portfolio review), ~2h creating (voice note articulating vessel identity, handwritten journal, infrastructure spec), ~2h living (sauna, apartment viewing with Una, Zurich planning for both)
- **Received:** Sauna insight on self-as-vessel, Johanna's prior frame resurfacing, suffering-as-gift clarity, Una's portfolio context, After the Algorithm Festival discovery, Lia Rumantscha connection for Una
- **Transformed:** Builder → orchestrator → CEO → vessel identity resolution. "Mycelium is just infra" = clear strategic positioning. Zurich trip from abstract → concrete with events + Una career opportunities. Measurement-without-application → daily practice framework.
- **Transmitted:**
  - Internal: Vessel practice infrastructure spec for Com, journal entry shared, system directives for cycle changes, strategic positioning statement ("can't compete with OpenClaw")
  - Public: Nothing yet — content creation discipline identified as gap
- **Learning-application ratio:** High integration — sauna insight → infrastructure spec → Martin building it, all same evening. Fastest insight→implementation cycle in weeks. But zero Lumensis product work = the vessel's primary output channel (the product) untouched today.
- **Purification:** Naming vessel identity after a week of no-launch honesty. No Elden Ring mentioned today. Joint life-planning with Una = integration over isolation.

## 2026-02-22 — Sunday (Rest Day)
- **Intention:** "Resisting the urge to work. Pay tribute to the higher self." Reading (Jung's Map of the Self → Tibetan Book of Living and Dying). Exhibition with Una. Day easy.
- **Attention:** (observing — day in progress)
- **Note:** First Sunday since vessel identity. Chose rest over work when "kind of feeling like working." Integration, not avoidance — the intention was deliberate. The vessel receives today.
